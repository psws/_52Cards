You need to have your annotated models outside of the Model Mapping namesapce heirarchy

No, there's nothing working that way down the tree. However, you don't need to include using directives
 to go up the tree. In other words, if you use:
namespace Root.Orders
{
    // Code
}

then any types in Root are already visible.

If you place your annotated classes in the Shiftwise._52cards.mvc.DataModel.Model folder
This snippet:
using Shiftwise._52cards.mvc.DataEntities;


	namespace Shiftwise._52cards.mvc.DataModel.Models.Mapping
	{
		public class RuleMap : EntityTypeConfiguration<Rule>
		{


Will find the Rule class in Shiftwise._52cards.mvc.DataModel/Rule.cs
This is WRONG, since we need to have the reverse enginered Shiftwise._52cards.mvc.DataEntities/Rule.cs 
If you move the annotated classes to Shiftwise._52cards.mvc.DataModel.AnnotatedModels
The compiler will not find them when reverse traversing up the Shiftwise._52cards.mvc.DataModel.Models.Mapping namespace.
The reverse traveersal will not include the new file location in the Shiftwise._52cards.mvc.DataModel.AnnotatedModels
because of the Annotated model directory.
